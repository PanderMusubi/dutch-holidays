Dutch Holidays
==============

Introduction
------------

This project offers an overview of Dutch holidays (Nederlandse feestdagen) from
2010 until the year 2050. The available are:
- in Dutch: [NederlandseFeestdagen.ics](https://raw.github.com/PanderMusubi/dutch-holidays/master/NederlandseFeestdagen.ics)
- in English: [DutchHolidays.ics](https://raw.github.com/PanderMusubi/dutch-holidays/master/DutchHolidays.ics)
- in German: [NiederlaendischeFeiertage.ics](https://raw.github.com/PanderMusubi/dutch-holidays/master/NiederlaendischeFeiertage.ics)
- in French: [JoursFeriesAuxPaysBas.ics](https://raw.github.com/PanderMusubi/dutch-holidays/master/JoursFeriesAuxPaysBas.ics)
- in Spanish: [VacacionesHolandesas.ics](https://raw.github.com/PanderMusubi/dutch-holidays/master/VacacionesHolandesas.ics)

In the non-Dutch versions, the Dutch name is used first first and the
translation is in brackets. This is because not all holidays can be
unambiguously translated, they do not exist in the other language or they do
exist but with a different meaning or with a different date. Examples that are
prone for confusion with English are Liberation Day, Mothers' Day, Fathers' Day,
Veterans Day etcetera.

Scope
-----

Public holidays in the Netherlands can be official or non-official, can be free
from work or not, can be national, regional or local and can be religious. This
makes it not an easy task to select which public holidays to include and which
not. Therefore the selection offered here is based upon the following criteria.

All holidays in the Netherlands which effect office hours. This can result in
total closure of a business or people leaving early. Subsequently this can
effect (part of) the country's infrastructure. The goal is to make people aware
about the risk of planning events on or near those days. People, businesses and
public services are probably not available as usual.

Perhaps you do not celibate certain religious holidays but your family, friends,
colleagues, suppliers or customers do. Next to making you aware of planning
risks, this calendar of course also indicates when you might have days off.

School holidays are omitted because they differ throughout the country, are
dependent on the level of education and are not planned many years in advance.
Most businesses in the Netherlands operate normally during school holidays.

Official Dutch public holidays here are of calendar category Public Holiday. All
other holidays have a calendar category called Unofficial Public Holiday.
Whether or not this constitutes a free day is entirely up to the line of work.
With the exception of Liberation Day, all of category Public Holiday usually
result in a day off.

Most calendar software can show these Dutch holidays to a color of your choice.
Also in some software, a distinction in colour can be configured according to
the calendar categories `Public Holiday` and `Unofficial Public Holiday`.

Warning: Please, do **not** import these ICS files into your calendar as they
will be added only once and never get updated. Add these calendars as a shared
(read-only) network calendar. These calendars do not need frequent updates,
however, sometimes bugs are fixed, future years are added or holidays change in
date or in name. See for example the transition from Queen's Day to King's Day,
that also got another date. Most software will have a maximum update frequency
of once a week, which is fine for these calendars. Syncing should also
configured to take place only from server to client, computer or phone.

Maintenance

The files are generated from the directories `scripted-holidays`,
`unscripted-holidays` and `templates` by running `generate.py`. This
will output `*.ics` files. The script `report.sh` will write a short overview in
`names-used-*.txt`.

Calendars that have been generated can be validated by:
