==============

This project offers an overview of Dutch holidays (Nederlandse feestdagen) from 2010 until the year 2050. The file called NederlandseFeestdagen.ics contains information only in Dutch. In the file Dutch Holidays.ics, is the same information in Dutch available but an English translation is added.

The reason in the latter version for using the Dutch names first and the translation in brackets is that not all holidays can be unambiguously translated or do not exist in the English speaking world or do exist but with a different meaning or with a different date. Examples that are prone for confusion are Liberation Day, Mothers' Day, Fathers' Day, Veterans Day etcetera.

Public holidays in the Netherlands can be official or non-official, can be free from work or not, can be national, regional or local and can be religious. This makes it not an easy task to select which public holidays to include and which not. Therefore the selection offered here is based upon the following criteria.

All holidays in the Netherlands which effect office hours. This can result in total closure of a business or people leaving early. Subsequently this can effect (part of) the country's infrastructure. The goal is to make people aware about the risk of planning events on or near those days. People, businesses and public services are probably not available as usual.

Perhaps you do not celibate certain religious holidays but your family, friends, colleges, suppliers or customers do. Next to making you aware of planning risks, this calendar of course also indicates when you might have days off.

School holidays are omitted because they differ throughout the country, are dependent on the level of education and are not planned many years in advance. Most businesses in the Netherlands operate normally during school holidays.

Official Dutch public holidays here are of calendar category Public Holiday. All other holidays have a calendar category called Unofficial Public Holiday. Whether or not this constitutes a free day is entirely up to the line of work. With the exception of Liberation Day, all of category Public Holiday usually result in a day off.
